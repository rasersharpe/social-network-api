## Description

This is an API for a social network. It gives users the ability to create, edit, delete and view all users. The same operations can be done for thoughts. You can add and delete friends and reactions.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your hard drive and then navigate to the repo in terminal or bash. Then run the command `node i` to install the Inquirer dependancy. Once installed type the command `node index.js`.

Then use Insomnia to test the routes and CRUD operations.

## Usage

[Here is a link to a video on usage ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBL6mbdZGU0)

## Collaborators

For this project, I sought help from the Xpert Learning Assistant and a tutor to help me understand the core concepts that go in to an app like this.
